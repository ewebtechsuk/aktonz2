A resilient service model combines automations, specialist partners, and a cadence of proactive communication.</p><h2>Map your recurring workflows</h2><p>List every touchpoint in the tenancy lifecycle—from marketing and viewings to compliance renewals and renewal conversations. Assign ownership, timeframes, and the tools that support each stage. Documenting these steps surfaces gaps and duplication.</p><h2>Invest in technology that plays nicely together</h2><p>Use a CRM and property management platform that can synchronise tasks, documents, and communications. Integrate calendar tools and shared inboxes so that your team can collaborate without forwarding emails.</p><h2>Create a playbook for partner support</h2><p>Maintenance contractors, compliance assessors, and inventory clerks all need clear briefs. Build template scopes of work, response-time SLAs, and a dashboard that shows live job status so nothing goes missing.</p><p>Finally, revisit the model every quarter. Measure void periods, response times, and landlord Net Promoter Scores to catch pressure points before they escalate.</p>",
