# Landlord Enquiry Enhancements for the Aktonz Chatbot

The landlord submission endpoint (`/api/chatbot/landlords`) captures structured details about new rental instructions so the lettings team can respond quickly. To expand on this foundation, consider layering in the following product ideas:

## Operational Automations
- **Instant CRM sync:** Push each enquiry into the landlord pipeline within your CRM, tagging the property address and desired go-live date so negotiators can triage leads automatically.
- **Lettings checklist generation:** Produce a templated onboarding checklist (EPC, Gas Safety, EICR, licensing, etc.) based on property type and borough regulations.
- **Calendar holds for valuation visits:** Offer suggested appointment slots and reserve provisional calendar events until the team confirms.

## Data Enrichment
- **Rental valuation benchmarks:** Use rental indices or your historic comps to estimate an achievable rent band and share it with the landlord as part of the confirmation message.
- **Compliance reminders:** Surface mandatory certificates and renewal dates based on the tenancy length and property type captured in the enquiry.
- **Portfolio insights:** If the landlord provides multiple addresses, aggregate them to highlight cross-selling opportunities (rent reviews, portfolio refinancing, etc.).

## Multi-Channel Engagement
- **Automated follow-up sequences:** Schedule emails/SMS nudges with educational resources (landlord guides, letting fees, management tiers) to keep the landlord engaged before a valuation.
- **Secure document upload:** Provide a link for landlords to submit key documents (proof of ownership, existing ASTs, compliance certificates) directly after the chatbot conversation.
- **Live transfer to lettings specialists:** During business hours, route high-intent enquiries to an available agent via live chat, voice, or calendar hand-off.

## Analytics & Feedback
- **Conversion dashboards:** Track time-to-response, valuation booking rate, and instruction win rate for chatbot-sourced landlord leads.
- **Quality scoring:** Allow negotiators to score lead quality, feeding a feedback loop that tunes the chatbot’s qualifying questions.
- **Knowledge-base triggers:** Capture FAQ themes from landlord conversations to prioritise new help-centre articles or webinar topics.

These ideas help the chatbot move beyond data capture and into a full landlord acquisition workflow that mirrors the lettings team’s day-to-day processes.
