# Aktonz SEO Plan (London Lettings Focus)

## Objectives

1. Rank Aktonz landing and listings pages on page one for "London letting agent" and intent-matched rental search terms.
2. Grow organic leads by improving visibility for long-tail renter queries (e.g., amenities, neighbourhood modifiers) surfaced in competitor copy.
3. Strengthen topical authority around managed rentals, corporate lets, and premium amenities to differentiate from aggregated portals.

## Keyword universe & prioritisation

### Primary targets (high volume, core intent)

| Keyword cluster | Rationale | Suggested target URL |
| --- | --- | --- |
| london letting agent | Competitive head term aligning with Aktonz's brand positioning; absent from competitor titles but relevant to service pages. | `/lettings` or dedicated "London Letting Agent" landing page |
| properties to rent in london | Dominant portal phrasing used by Rightmove & Zoopla titles. Capture blended intent with optimised listings index page. | `/rent` |
| flats to rent in london | High-frequency variation in competitor meta descriptions; aligns with Aktonz listings inventory. | `/rent/flats` filtered collection |

### Secondary opportunities (mid volume, commercial intent)

| Keyword cluster | Insight source | Page focus |
| --- | --- | --- |
| luxury apartments to rent london | Scraye emphasises "modern", "concierge", "high ceilings"—opportunity for premium segmentation. | New landing page highlighting amenities-driven lets |
| pet friendly flats london | Scraye copy references pets & bills repeatedly—create pet-friendly filters & content. | Blog guide + filtered listings |
| corporate let london | Competitor gap; incorporate service content for relocations and corporate lets. | Service page or pillar article |
| furnished flats london | Frequent in Aktonz data ("fully", "modern")—reinforce in headings and filters. | `/rent/furnished` |

### Long-tail / supporting content ideas

* "Studio flats with concierge in [Neighbourhood]"
* "London rentals with gym and co-working"
* "Bills included apartments near [Transport hub]"
* "Pet friendly rentals under £2,000 pcm"

These combine Scraye's amenity-heavy language (`storage`, `windows`, `gym`, `amenities`, `pcm`) with Aktonz's existing copy, giving scope for targeted guides and landing pages.

## On-page optimisation roadmap

1. **Rework `/rent` template**
   * Update `<title>` to `Properties to Rent in London | Aktonz Letting Agents` and meta description to highlight unique value (e.g., in-house management, virtual tours).
   * Introduce an H1 that mirrors the primary keyword while weaving in differentiators ("Curated London Rentals with Concierge-Level Support").
   * Add introductory copy (~120 words) referencing primary and secondary clusters plus internal links to filtered collections (pet-friendly, furnished, luxury, neighbourhoods).

2. **Create segmented landing pages**
   * Build static pages for `Pet-Friendly Flats in London`, `Luxury Apartments to Rent in London`, and `Corporate Lets in London` using dynamic listing embeds filtered by relevant attributes.
   * For each page, craft structured sections: overview paragraph, amenity highlights (pulling from features like `concierge`, `gym`, `storage`), neighbourhood spotlights, and FAQ schema.

3. **Blog & resource calendar**
   * Publish two guides per month targeting long-tail intents (e.g., "How to Find Bills-Inclusive Flats in London"), embedding listings and CTAs.
   * Use FAQ and HowTo schema where applicable to capture People Also Ask opportunities.

4. **Schema & internal linking**
   * Implement `ItemList` schema on listing indices and `RealEstateAgent` schema on about/service pages.
   * Cross-link new landing pages from the homepage hero, footer, and relevant blog posts to build authority.

## Technical SEO checks

* Ensure listings pages load server-side rendered content for bots (avoid the empty responses observed on Scraye/OpenRent).
* Generate and submit XML sitemaps segmented by property type and content type.
* Enforce clean URL structures for filters (`/rent/pet-friendly`, `/rent/luxury`, `/rent/[area]`).
* Add canonical tags on filtered pages to prevent duplication.
* Monitor Core Web Vitals—optimise image delivery (WebP, responsive sizes) for rich media-heavy listings.

## Off-page & authority building

* **Partnership outreach**: Target relocation blogs, London lifestyle publications, and co-working spaces with guest content around concierge rentals and remote-work-ready flats.
* **Local citations**: Audit and standardise NAP data across Google Business Profile, Bing Places, Yelp, and niche directories like AllAgents.
* **Digital PR**: Launch quarterly data stories using Aktonz listings (e.g., amenity trends, average PCM by neighbourhood) to earn press backlinks.

## Measurement & KPIs

* Track rankings weekly for the primary and secondary keyword sets above.
* Monitor organic sessions and enquiries to `/rent` and new landing pages.
* Use Search Console to surface emerging long-tail queries and iterate content.
* Attribute leads via CRM tagging to quantify SEO-driven revenue.

## Execution timeline (90-day outline)

1. **Weeks 1–2**: Keyword mapping, update existing `/rent` metadata and copy, implement schema foundations.
2. **Weeks 3–6**: Launch pet-friendly and luxury landing pages, set up sitemap & canonical improvements.
