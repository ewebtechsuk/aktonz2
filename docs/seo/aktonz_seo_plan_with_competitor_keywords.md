# Aktonz SEO Plan – Integrating Competitor Keyword Insights (Oct 2025)

## Objectives

1. **Dominate key estate‑agency SERPs**: achieve top‑10 rankings for core phrases such as *“London estate agent”*, *“properties to rent in London”* and *“properties for sale in London”*.
2. **Expand organic visibility beyond lettings** by targeting high‑intent search terms used by competitors (e.g. **“short and long lets”**, **“buy or rent houses and flats”**), capturing both renter and buyer traffic.
3. **Reinforce Aktonz’s local authority** by emphasising its coverage across London boroughs and positioning the brand as a trusted, award‑winning property expert.

## Keyword universe & prioritisation

### Primary targets (high volume, commercial intent)

| Keyword cluster | Rationale | Suggested target URL |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **london estate agent / estate agents in london** | Core phrase used by every competitor. Reflects the generic service Aktonz offers; important for the home page and about pages【847900104304182†L10-L16】【622536778394010†L0-L1】. | `/` (home) and `/about` |
| **properties to rent in london** | Present in Rightmove/Zoopla titles and implied in competitor meta descriptions. Captures renters searching generically; aligns with Aktonz’s lettings inventory. | `/rent` |
| **properties for sale in london / houses for sale in london** | Foxtons and Winkworth emphasise property sales and buy‑to‑let services【622536778394010†L0-L1】【565809182661381†L7-L22】; adding a sales landing page will broaden Aktonz’s reach. | `/sell` or new `/buy` page |
| **short and long lets in london** | Foxtons explicitly targets both short and long lets【622536778394010†L0-L1】. Optimise Aktonz’s rentals page for this phrase. | `/rent/short-lets` & `/rent/long-lets` |
| **letting agents in london / london letting agent** | Reinforces Aktonz’s core service and appears in competitor titles and descriptions; strong for local pack results. | `/lettings` |

### Secondary opportunities (mid‑volume and gap terms)

| Keyword cluster | Insight source | Page focus |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **east london estate agents / estate agents in [borough]** | Keatons ranks for East London‑specific searches【847900104304182†L10-L16】. Create borough‑based landing pages (e.g. `Hackney Estate Agents`) and link from the main navigation. | Borough‑specific pages (static `/east-london`, `/south-london`, etc.) |
| **local property experts / award‑winning estate agent** | Used by Keatons, Stirling Ackroyd and Dexters【179487723100304†L70-L74】【854201591711256†L5-L7】. Include these phrases in meta descriptions and trust‑building sections to signal authority. | Home page, About page |
| **property valuation london** | Stirling Ackroyd and Dexters promote free property valuations【179487723100304†L70-L74】. Offer a valuation tool with an optimised landing page targeting valuation queries. | `/valuation` |
| **buy or rent houses & flats** | Winkworth’s meta description invites visitors to buy or rent houses and flats【565809182661381†L7-L22】. Repurpose this language on Aktonz’s home page to capture dual‑intent users. | Home page copy |

### Long‑tail / supporting content ideas

- “Award‑winning East London estate agents”
- “Short‑let apartments with concierge near [Tube station]”
- “How to choose a London estate agent for selling your flat”
- “Free property valuation in [Borough]”
- “Local property experts: why branch presence matters in London”

## On‑page optimisation roadmap

1. **Home page re‑optimisation**
   - Update the `<title>` tag to **“Aktonz – London Estate Agents & Property Experts”** and the meta description to highlight Aktonz’s local expertise and dual focus on sales and rentals (e.g., “Your local London estate agent offering properties to rent and buy, including short and long lets, across the capital”).
   - Use an H1 heading such as **“London Estate Agents with a Personal Touch”** and a supporting subheading emphasising award‑winning service and branch coverage.  Include paragraphs that weave in primary keywords (*“properties to rent in London”*, *“properties for sale in London”*) and link to `/rent` and `/sell` pages.
   - Add internal links to borough‑specific pages (East London, South London etc.) and to the valuation page.

2. **Rentals page (`/rent`)**
   - Adjust the title tag to **“Properties to Rent in London – Short & Long Lets | Aktonz”** and craft a meta description referencing “flats and houses to rent across London, including furnished, pet‑friendly and short‑let options.”
   - Ensure the H1 mirrors the primary keyword (“Properties to Rent in London”) and add an introductory paragraph summarising Aktonz’s unique selling points (in‑house management, concierge‑style support).  Include links to filtered collections (pet‑friendly, furnished, luxury, short‑let).  
   - Build out dedicated subpages for **short lets** and **long lets** to capture those search modifiers.

3. **Sales page (`/sell` or `/buy`)**
   - Create a new landing page targeting **“Properties for Sale in London”** and related phrases.  Title tag example: **“Houses & Flats for Sale in London | Aktonz Estate Agents.”**  
   - Include copy explaining Aktonz’s sales services, emphasising local expertise and branch coverage.  Provide CTAs for valuations and seller guides.

4. **Valuation page (`/valuation`)**
   - Build an SEO‑friendly landing page offering free property valuations.  Optimise for queries like **“property valuation London”** and **“free house valuation in [Borough].”**  Use structured data (e.g., `Service` schema) and a lead‑capture form.

5. **Borough pages**
   - Develop static pages for priority areas (e.g., East London, Hackney, Islington).  Each page should have its own title and description (e.g., “Hackney Estate Agents – Buy or Rent in Hackney”) and contain local market insights, featured listings and internal links back to `/rent` and `/sell`.

6. **Blog & resources**
   - Publish two posts per month targeting long‑tail topics (e.g., “What are short lets and are they right for you?”, “How to get a property valuation in East London”).  Incorporate FAQ schema to capture People Also Ask opportunities.

7. **Schema & technical tasks**
   - Implement `RealEstateAgent` schema on the home/about pages and `ItemList`/`Product` schema on listing indices to enhance rich snippets.
   - Generate an XML sitemap that includes new sales, valuation and borough pages.  Ensure pages are accessible server‑side (avoid client‑only rendering).  Add canonical tags on filtered listing pages to prevent duplicate content.

## Off‑page & authority building

- **Local citations & branch pages**: Standardise Aktonz’s name, address and phone number across Google Business Profile, Bing Places, Yelp and niche estate‑agent directories.  Create or update branch pages with consistent NAP details.
- **Digital PR & outreach**: Issue press releases or data‑driven stories (e.g., “Average London rent for short lets vs long lets”) to property journalists and blogs to earn backlinks.  Partner with local businesses (co‑working spaces, relocation services) for guest posts around “local property experts.”
- **Partnerships with neighbourhood guides**: Collaborate with community sites and bloggers covering specific London boroughs to link to Aktonz’s borough pages.

## Measurement & KPIs

- Track keyword rankings weekly for the primary and secondary terms listed above.
- Monitor organic traffic and lead conversions to `/rent`, `/sell` and `/valuation` pages via analytics and CRM tags.
- Use Google Search Console’s *Performance* report to identify emerging queries and refine content accordingly.
- Assess backlink growth and citation accuracy quarterly to ensure off‑page signals improve domain authority.
