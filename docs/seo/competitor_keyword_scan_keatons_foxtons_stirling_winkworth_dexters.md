## Implications for Aktonz

- **Align terminology**: Aktonz should consistently use the core phrase **“London estate agent”** in its home\u2011page title and headings.  Adding descriptors like “local property experts” or “award\u2011winning” can mirror competitor language while emphasising quality.
- **Broaden the keyword footprint**: Alongside the existing focus on lettings, include high\u2011volume phrases from competitors such as **“properties to rent in London”**, **“properties for sale in London”**, **“short and long lets”**, **“houses and flats to buy or rent”**, **“estate agents in East\u00a0London”**, and **“property valuation”**.  These terms can populate meta titles, descriptions, H1 tags and internal anchor text.
- **Highlight locality and scale**: Competitors showcase their branch networks.  If applicable, Aktonz should indicate its service coverage across London boroughs and any local offices to build trust.
- **Emphasise expertise**: Using modifiers like *market\u2011leading*, *experienced*, or *award\u2011winning* in copy and snippets can mirror competitor messaging and appeal to quality\u2011conscious clients.
